# April 20, 2015:  This repository is now frozen! The development version of EAZY can now be found at https://github.com/gbrammer/eazy-photoz/ #

EAZY is a photometric redshift code designed to produce high-quality redshifts over 0<z<4 for situations where complete spectroscopic calibration samples are not available. Details of the algorithm and tests of the code on public multi-wavelength photometric datasets are presented by Brammer, van Dokkum & Coppi (2008)

The version of the code in the "Downloads" tab is the same as was provided with the original publication of the code.  To obtain the latest version (**HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**), follow the instructions for checking out the SVN repository on the "Source" tab.

Please include a citation to "Brammer, van Dokkum & Coppi, 2008, ApJ, 686, 1503" in the bibliography of any published work that makes use of EAZY.
